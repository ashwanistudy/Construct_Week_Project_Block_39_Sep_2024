## Context:
Scheduling meetings and appointments can be a tedious task, often involving numerous back-and-forth emails to find a mutually convenient time. This project aims to develop a web-based scheduling application that allows users to set their availability, share booking links, and manage appointments seamlessly.

## Project Goal:
This web application enabling users to set their availability, share booking links, and manage appointments. The application should include features for scheduling, sending notifications, and integrating with calendars. Provide a user-friendly interface to ensure a smooth scheduling experience.

## Features:
1. **User Authentication**:
    - Allow users to sign up, log in, and log out.
    - 
2. **Availability Settings**:
    - Users can set their availability for different days and times.
    - Allow users to create multiple types of events with different durations (e.g., 15-minute meeting, 30-minute consultation).
      
3. **Booking Link**:
    - Generate a unique booking link for each user that they can share with others.
      
4. **Appointment Booking**:
    - Allow others to view the userâ€™s availability and book appointments.
    - Prevent double bookings by ensuring times are blocked out once an appointment is booked.
      
6. **Appointment Management**:
    - Users can view, edit, and cancel their appointments.
      
7. **Calendar Integration**:
    - Integrate with popular calendar services (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook) to automatically update availability and booked appointments.
      
8. **Buffer Time and Padding**:
    - Allow users to set buffer times before and after appointments to prevent back-to-back bookings.
      
9. **Timezone Support**:
    - Automatically handle timezones for both the user and the person booking the appointment.
       
12. **Group Events**:
    - Allow users to create group events where multiple participants can join the same appointment.
      
13. **Payment Integration**:
    - Integrate with payment gateways to allow users to charge for appointments.
